# Rewriting-the-C4-Compiler-in-Rust
Final Project for Principles of Programming course in Khalifa University
Objective:
Building on your analysis of the C4 compiler from Assignment 1, your team will rewrite the
C4 compiler in Rust. The Rust version must compile the same subset of C code as the
original C4 compiler (e.g., the C4 source code itself), maintaining its self-hosting capability
and core functionality. This project leverages Rustâ€™s safety, modern features, and
performance to reimplement the compiler, ensuring equivalence to the original while
improving design where possible.
